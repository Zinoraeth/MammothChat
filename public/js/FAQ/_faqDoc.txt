This is the documentation for the FAQ Controller, subfunctions and functionality.

To use the FAQ filter functionality you will have to instanciate a Controller from FaqController.js
The controller will act as the base for the functionality of the FAQ system.

The controller is an extention of the Defaults Settings class which means it will provide you access
to all the settings available to the Controller.

The controller has 2 main methods which are test() and execute().
execute() runs the controller with all it's current settings while the test() method will run
the execute with an try-catch and display additional commentary useful for debugging.

The controller inherits various properties from the Defaults class which you can access and modify
to alter the output of the FAQ function.
